# Web Scraping Libraries Research Findings

## Text Scraping Libraries
1. **react-native-cheerio**
   - A fork of Cheerio adapted for React Native
   - Uses jQuery-like syntax for DOM manipulation
   - Good for parsing HTML content
   - Installation: `npm install react-native-cheerio`

2. **Axios**
   - HTTP client for making requests
   - Compatible with React Native
   - Can be used to fetch HTML content for parsing
   - Installation: `npm install axios`

## Image Scraping Approaches
1. **WebView + HTML Parsing**
   - Use React Native WebView to load pages
   - Parse HTML to extract image URLs
   - Download images using React Native's Image API or fetch

2. **React Native Image Libraries**
   - react-native-image-picker: For selecting images from device
   - FastImage: For efficient image loading and caching

## Authentication Handling
1. **Token-based Authentication**
   - Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
   - Store tokens securely using AsyncStorage or SecureStore

2. **Cookie-based Authentication**
   - Handle cookies with libraries like react-native-cookies
   - Maintain session state across requests

3. **WebView Authentication**
   - Use WebView to handle login forms
   - Extract cookies or tokens after successful authentication

## Modular Architecture Approach
1. **Service Layer**
   - Create separate services for different scraping targets
   - Implement common utilities for request handling and parsing

2. **Configuration-based Scraping**
   - Define scraping targets and selectors in configuration files
   - Allow dynamic updates to scraping rules

## Best Practices
1. **Respect robots.txt and website terms**
2. **Implement rate limiting to avoid overloading servers**
3. **Add proper error handling and retry mechanisms**
4. **Cache results when appropriate to reduce requests**
5. **Handle different screen sizes and device capabilities**
